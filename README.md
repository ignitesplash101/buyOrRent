# Predicting whether to buy or rent in Japan (Real Estate Investment, go or no go)

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive financial analysis for individuals looking to understand the financial implications of buying vs. renting a property in Japan. The code calculates the net worth outcome of both scenarios and performs a Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis to consider various market conditions and financial parameters.

## Features

- **Buy vs. Rent Calculator**: Calculates and compares the net worth outcome over time of buying a property vs. renting a property.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Runs thousands of simulations to understand the potential variance in outcomes due to market changes.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Examines how sensitive the net worth outcome is to changes in key financial parameters such as purchase price, loan interest, investment rate, and maintenance costs.
- **Visualization**: Plots the net worth over time and the distribution of outcomes from the Monte Carlo simulation for both scenarios.
